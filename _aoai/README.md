# How to use Azure OpenAI (AOAI)

In addition to (mostly US-hosted) API model endpoints, the app also supports `Azure OpenAI Services (AOAI)`. 

Find the docs here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/


**Benefits**:
- OpenAI models can be deployed within the __Swiss Azure Cloud Region__ (e.g. `switzerlandnorth`) or regions within the EU (like `westeurope`). 
- Using `switzerlandnorth` means that none of your prompts/data will leave Switzerland. 
- This may help with achieving compliance and adress data residency considerations and governance. 

- AOAI services adhere to the enterprise-grade data privacy and security controls for Microsoft Azure. 
- Some good reference documents:
  - [Azure Product terms](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms/productoffering/MicrosoftAzure/MCA#Documents)
  - [Cloud Services in the Swiss Public Sector (Overview page)](https://news.microsoft.com/de-ch/azure-services-in-the-swiss-public-sector/)
  - [Azure Services in the Public Sector in Switzerland - DE](https://news.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/418/2021/11/Cloud-Design_Azure-Services-Swiss-Public-Sector_DE.pdf)


**Important**: You still need to ensure appropriate classification and handling of your data, especially for sensitive and/or personal data. 
Check with your Microsoft contact or Cloud Service Provider (Partner) representative for further questions.


**Prerequisites**:
- An active **Azure account**. If you don't have one, click [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services)
- In your account, an **Azure Subscription** that has been enabled for Azure OpenAI Services 
    - apply here: https://aka.ms/oaiapply (takes ~24hrs to activate)


## Walkthrough

- Go to https://portal.azure.com
- From the Catalog, choose `Azure OpenAI service`

- You need to select (or create) a new **Resource Group**, choose the Cloud **Region** and a unique service **Name** (becomes part of the endpoint url) 
- **Note:** Not all model versions are available in all regions, see [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models). The region can't be changed afterwards (you'll need to delete & create a new service instance in that case)

- Follow the wizard to the end, and create the service.
- Once the service instance is ready, find the overview and `Go to Azure OpenAI Studio`

- In the `Azure Open AI Studio`, go to `Deployments` and create a new model deployment. 
- **Note**: If you can't create a particular model type, that model may be unavailable in your region, or your quota may be exceeded.

- Take note of the **deployment name** - this is needed later for making API calls

- Now go back and find the **Endpoint** and **API Key**. Multiple ways to find, but one is clicking on the gear icon on top of OpenAI Studio:

<img src="../_imgs/aoai_endpoint_and_key.png" style="width: 800px; border: none" />


- Now add these credentials to your `_streamlit_app/.env` file, like this:
```
(... other keys ...)
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=....
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=....
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT=....
```


- Start the application (`cd _streamlit_app/ && python -m streamlit run ./sprache-vereinfachen.py)

## Known limitations
- Currently the "One-Klick" feature does not use the Azure OpenAI model
- While latest OpenAI models find their way to Azure quite fast, some may be restricted to higher tiers for capacity reasons or arrive later (e.g. `GPT-4o` at the time of this writing). Open a support ticket or talk to your Microsot rep if in doubt.
